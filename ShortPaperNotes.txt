Your topic is **valid and fits well within the assignment guidelines**. Hereâ€™s why:

### **1. Your Topic Aligns with Breyâ€™s Core Argument**  
Philip Breyâ€™s article focuses on **anticipating ethical issues in emerging IT**. Quantum computing is **one of the most disruptive emerging technologies**, and its **unintended consequences in finance, AI, and security** directly relate to Brey's key themes:
- **Unforeseen risks** â†’ Quantum AI systems like Deep Seek caused unintended economic damage.
- **Ethical foresight** â†’ Brey argues that we need to predict and mitigate risks before they cause harm.
- **Policy & governance** â†’ How should society regulate quantum computing to prevent harm?

By framing Deep Seek as **a real-world case study**, youâ€™re **applying Breyâ€™s methodology** to a contemporary example, which your professor wants you to do.

### **2. It Follows the Assignment Structure**
âœ… **Explains Breyâ€™s rationale and methodology**  
- Brey argues that **we must anticipate ethical risks in emerging IT** before crises occur.  
- You connect this idea to **Deep Seekâ€™s financial disruption**, showing that this was an **unanticipated ethical issue** that could have been prevented with foresight.

âœ… **Focuses on a contemporary technology (quantum computing)**  
- Your example is well-chosen because quantum computing is still **new and unpredictable**, making it a perfect fit for discussing ethical foresight.

âœ… **Compares Breyâ€™s model to ethical theories**  
- You analyze whether **utilitarianism, deontology, or virtue ethics** would have led to **better ethical safeguards for AI-driven stock trading**.

âœ… **Discusses policy, legal, and ethical implications**  
- You propose **new regulations, transparency requirements, and ethical constraints** on quantum-powered AI systems.

### **3. Why This Topic Works for Your Professor**
Your professor **wants you to apply Breyâ€™s approach to a specific example**. You **aren't deviating** from the article; rather, youâ€™re **applying its ideas** to a real-world event that showcases the very problem Brey warns about.

ðŸ”¹ If your professor is strict, you can **add a sentence in your introduction** to explicitly **tie your topic back to Brey**:
> "This paper applies Breyâ€™s methodology of ethical foresight to **quantum computing and financial AI systems**, using Deep Seekâ€™s market disruption as a case study. This incident demonstrates the risks Brey warns about: **emerging IT can have unintended ethical consequences** if not properly anticipated."

This makes it **crystal clear** that your focus **follows Breyâ€™s argument** and is not just a random case study.

### **Final Verdict: Your Topic is a Strong Fit**
âœ… **Youâ€™re applying Breyâ€™s methodology, not ignoring it.**  
âœ… **Youâ€™re focusing on a contemporary emerging technology.**  
âœ… **Youâ€™re discussing ethics, policy, and regulationâ€”exactly what the assignment asks for.**  
âœ… **Youâ€™re following the assignment structure.**
