typedef int ItemType; - we can have many types of stack, ingeteger character etc
- in a stack, you put items like in an array at index, 0, then 1, then 2 etc
- you need to keep track of this by using the top
- zero is the first position so when it is empty we will know by setting top to -1

- Implement stack with linked list

struct Node {
  ItemType value;
  Node *next;
};

Node *head; --> To record the top of the stack

Overflow: Trying to push in a full stack
Underflow: Trying to pop an emtpy stack

Key Differences Between Notations
Operator Position:

Infix: The operator is placed between operands (e.g., A + B).
Postfix: The operator is placed after operands (e.g., AB +).
Prefix: The operator is placed before operands (e.g., + AB).
Use of Parentheses:

Infix: Parentheses are sometimes required to enforce precedence (e.g., (A + B) * C).
Postfix: Parentheses are not needed; the order of evaluation is inherent.
Prefix: Parentheses are not needed; the order of evaluation is inherent.
Evaluation Order:

Infix: Follows operator precedence and uses parentheses when needed.
Postfix: Evaluated from left to right as operators appear.
Prefix: Evaluated from right to left as operators appear.

stringstream

s>>ss;
ss>>a;
print -> a;

PostFix Algorithm:
WHILE more input items exist
  GET an item
  IF item is an operand 
  stack.push(item)
ELSE
  stack.Pop(operand2)
  stack.Pop(operand1)
  stack.Push(result)
stack.Pop(result)

STACK - LIFO
QUEUE - FIFO
