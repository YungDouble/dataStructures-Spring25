Absolutely! Letâ€™s go over each one step by step â€” Iâ€™ll explain the concept, how it works, and give a simple example for each. These are *must-know* algorithms for graphs in data structures.

---

## ðŸ”· 1. **BFS (Breadth-First Search)**

### ðŸ“Œ Concept:
- Explores a graph **level by level**
- Uses a **queue (FIFO)**
- Great for finding the shortest path in **unweighted graphs**

### ðŸ§  Pseudocode:
```cpp
BFS(Graph, start):
    create a queue Q
    mark start as visited
    enqueue start

    while Q is not empty:
        node = dequeue Q
        for each neighbor of node:
            if neighbor not visited:
                mark neighbor as visited
                enqueue neighbor
```

### ðŸ”„ Order Example:
If the graph is:
```
A - B
|   |
C - D
```
BFS starting at A â†’ A, B, C, D

---

## ðŸ”· 2. **DFS (Depth-First Search)**

### ðŸ“Œ Concept:
- Explores **as far as possible** along one branch before backtracking
- Uses a **stack** (either implicit via recursion or explicit)

### ðŸ§  Pseudocode:
```cpp
DFS(Graph, node):
    mark node as visited
    for each neighbor of node:
        if neighbor not visited:
            DFS(Graph, neighbor)
```

### ðŸ”„ Order Example:
Same graph:
```
A - B
|   |
C - D
```
DFS from A â†’ A, C, D, B *(order can vary)*

## ðŸ”· 3. **Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm**

### ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
Find the **shortest path** from a start node to all others in a **weighted, non-negative** graph.

### ðŸ›  Uses a **min-heap / priority queue**

### ðŸ§  Pseudocode (high-level):
```cpp
Dijkstra(Graph, start):
    set distance[start] = 0, others = âˆž
    create min-heap Q with (start, 0)

    while Q not empty:
        (node, dist) = extract_min from Q
        for each neighbor:
            if new_dist < current_dist:
                update dist[neighbor]
                add to Q
```

### ðŸ”„ Example:
Weighted graph:
```
A --2-- B --3-- C
 \      |
  \--1--D
```
Shortest path from A â†’ D = 1  
From A â†’ C = 1 (to D) + 3 (to C) = 4

## ðŸ”· 4. **Primâ€™s Algorithm**

### ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
Find the **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)** of a connected, weighted graph.

- Greedy
- Starts from any node and grows the MST
- Uses a **priority queue**

### ðŸ§  Steps:
1. Start with any node.
2. Add the smallest edge that connects a new node to the MST.
3. Repeat until all nodes are included.

### ðŸ”„ Key:
- Keeps track of **visited nodes**
- Chooses the **smallest edge** connecting MST to a non-MST node

---

## ðŸ”· 5. **Kruskalâ€™s Algorithm**

### ðŸ“Œ Purpose:
Also finds **MST**, but works differently from Primâ€™s.

- Greedy
- Sorts **all edges** by weight and picks the smallest
- Uses **Union-Find / Disjoint Set** to avoid cycles

### ðŸ§  Steps:
1. Sort all edges by weight.
2. For each edge:
   - If it connects two **disconnected** components â†’ add it.
   - Else â†’ skip (would create a cycle).
3. Stop when MST has (V - 1) edges.

|---------------|-----------------------------|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **BFS**       | Traverse level by level     | Queue                | Shortest path in unweighted     |
| **DFS**       | Traverse deep first         | Stack / Recursion    | Good for connectivity/islands   |
| **Dijkstra**  | Shortest path (weighted)    | Min-Heap             | Non-negative weights only       |
| **Primâ€™s**    | Minimum Spanning Tree       | Priority Queue       | Greedy, grows from one node     |
| **Kruskalâ€™s** | Minimum Spanning Tree       | Union-Find (DSU)     | Greedy, edge-sorted             |
